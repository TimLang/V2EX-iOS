## Swift Work!
Now I'm working on creating a new branch using the wonderful Swift!

## How to start?

## Author's message
I'm a beginner of programming. As a result, there are many shortcomings of this project. If you find them, please tell me.  
In addition, I'm also a English learners who attempt to write code comments in English. There might be a lot of communication confusions. Please spur on me.  

By the way, if you'd like to use Chinese. Just do it. And you can ask me to translate some of my poor English into Chinese XD.  
顺便说下，如果您希望使用汉语，那就用吧。您也可以要求我把一些说得不好的英文翻译为中文。  

Thank you very much!
